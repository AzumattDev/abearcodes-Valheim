# Simple Recycler

![demo](https://i.imgur.com/91ILtUh.png)

Adds a button that recycles (uncrafts) items in any container. 

### Key points

- Should work in 99% of the situations as the mod is laughably simple.
- Not propely tested! Beta, WIP, you name it! I had an hour and an idea. Actually, it took longer to release this mod and write this README than to write the mod itself! 
- You need to know the recipe for the item to "uncraft" it
- Has a fail safe to prevent accidental presses

## Development plans

- introduce a separate buildable "station" to do the uncrafting
- introduce a "loss" factor when uncrafting, right now uncrafts 1:1
- add option to uncraft even if recipe is unknown

## Configurability

None for now
