# Simple Auto Game Start

Once you start the game it loads you into the configured single player world
with the configured character. That's it. No lobby joining. Nothing. 

Will print an error if it can't find the right character or world. Remember to tweak the config. 

##### Why? 
Restarting during development and transpiler patching is a pain.
